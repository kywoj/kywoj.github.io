<h1>MLA 8th Edition &ndash; Web-based Resource</h1>

<h2>Saginaw Valley State University Writing Center</h2>

<p>The eighth edition of the <em>Handbook</em> (2016) has changed quite a bit from the seventh. The actual entries on a Works Cited page may look similar, but the principles between the old documentation style and this new one are significantly different.</p>

<p>Rather than having to consult the <em>Handbook</em> or other resource to determine the proper way to cite a specific type of source (the method you probably used with previous editions of MLA), you now have in the eighth edition a universal set of guidelines that you can apply to any source, no matter the medium.</p>

<p>What this means is that you will create the entries on your Works Cited page by determining which of the nine core elements (explained below) are available in or applicable to each of your sources. Then, based on those elements, you will compile your entry in the recommended order (explained below).</p> 


<p><h3>Works Cited Guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
     <li>Start on a new page with a page number; center the words &quot;Works Cited&quot; at top. This should be the last page of your paper (unless you have appendices).</li>
     <li>Include all sources cited in the text, both primary and secondary, whether summarized, paraphrased, or quoted.</li>
     <li>Do not include sources consulted but not cited.</li>
     <li>Alphabetize sources by the last name of the author or the first significant word of the title if the work has no author.</li>
     <li>Use a hanging indent (indent the second and subsequent lines in each entry).</li>
     <li>Apply MLA rules for capitalization. (See page 67 of the <em>MLA Handbook</em> for more information.)</li>
     <li>Maintain double-spacing. (Note: Examples that follow have been single-spaced to conserve space.)</li>
  </ul>
</p>



<h3>Terms to Keep in Mind</h3>
<p>Certain words used in this edition of MLA may seem unclear because they&#39;re used in unconventional ways; reference these definitions to learn how these terms are used. </p>

    <td>This refers to larger works (like a database or newspaper) that contain smaller works (like individual articles). These smaller works are &quot;nested&quot; within the larger work.</td>

<p>The first step is to determine whether your source has an author.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If it doesn&#39;t, you can skip this element in your citation.</li>
		<li>If it does have an author, determine whether it is one author, two authors, three or more authors, an individual other than an author (like a translator), someone using a pseudonym, or a corporate author. Then format according to the relevant examples below.</li>

<p><sup>1</sup> In this instance, the emphasis is not on the writer of the work, but another person linked to the work. In the Burgess citation, the student is writing a paper comparing two different translations of Sophocles&#39; play rather than doing a close reading of one translation of the play.
