# I'm Kylie.

I'm a researcher, writer, and designer committed to making information easier to use.

I graduated with my Bachelor of Arts in Professional & Technical Communication from Saginaw Valley State University in 2017 and my Master of Science degree from the University of Michigan in 2019. I’m currently based in Michigan, working as an Associate Director at Merck.
