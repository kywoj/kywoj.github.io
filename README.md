# Hi, I'm Ky!

I'm a researcher, writer, and designer committed to making information easier to use.

I’m now preparing to graduate with my Master of Science degree from the University of Michigan and currently seeking full-time opportunities in the fields of user experience, information architecture, or content strategy.
