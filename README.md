# Hi, I'm Ky!

I'm a researcher, writer, and designer committed to making information easier to use.

I graduated with my Master of Science degree from the University of Michigan in 2019. I’m currently based in Providence, Rhode Island, working as a UX Researcher & Strategist at Merck. Previously, I was a Senior UX Researcher at CVS Health.
