# Hi, I'm Ky!

I'm a researcher, writer, and designer committed to making information easier to use.

I’ve just graduated with my Master of Science degree from the University of Michigan. I'll start working as a UX Researcher at CVS in Cumberland, Rhode Island, in June.

Reach me at kywoj [at] umich.edu.
