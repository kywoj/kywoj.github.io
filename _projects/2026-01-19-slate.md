## Overview
Since October 2017, I've worked as a UX research intern with the Office of Enrollment Management's [Slate](https://technolutions.com/) implementation team. I've conducted dozens of contextual interviews with stakeholders across the university about how data related to recruitment, applications, and student events are currently managed. Then, in most cases, I map how information flows between departments and offices, providing the implementation team a clear visualization from which to base subsequent administrative decisions about how the Slate tool should be configured.

## Background
Here, I'll describe one advisory project I did in January 2018: I created a swimlane diagram to visualize how information was received, altered, and sent between departments and offices during the planning and execution of an [admitted student event](https://admissions.umich.edu/apply/admitted-students/freshman-next-steps/campus-day-0).

## Methodology
I conducted a contextual interview with an OUA (Office of Undergraduate Admissions) senior recruitment coordinator. Following a semi-structured protocol, I learned about the event logistics, especially
 * how students and their families register for and get information about the event and
 * how OUA works with academic units and Conferences & Events Services to plan and host the event.

 In cases where the coordinator was unsure about the details of the planning and execution processes, I followed up with others to fill in the gaps.

## Findings
I presented the following swimlane diagram to the Slate implementation team, and it was used as a visualization of the current planning and execution process for this admitted student event: a baseline for how those processes could be simplified, performed completely within Slate.
